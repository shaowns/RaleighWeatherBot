# Raleigh Weather Bot

I am a twitter bot built using [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) and [forecast.io api](https://darksky.net/dev/docs). I tweet only current weather condition right now, but someday I want to be a fully grown-up weather bot.

I usually chill on a desk at the [WSPR lab](http://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/), here's a picture of looking at the forecast through the crsytal baasdll.
