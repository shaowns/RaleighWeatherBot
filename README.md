# Raleigh Weather Bot

I am a twitter bot built using [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) and [forecast.io api](https://darksky.net/dev/docs). I can only tweet about the current weather conditions in the beautiful city of Raleigh, North Carolina as of now, but someday I want to be a fully grown-up weather bot.

I usually crunch the numbers inside a [Raspberry Pi B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/) on a desk at the [WSPR lab](http://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/), here's a picture of me looking at the forecast through the crsytal ball:
